Phoenix is a simple todo app, based on Vue.js

## The stack

Frontend:

- TypeScript
- Axios
- Vue Test Utils with Jest
- Tailwind

Backend

## Intallations

1. Clone
2. From the root directory run `npm run install:all` to install both the front and the backend.
3. Create an `.env` file in `/client` as described in the example file `/client/.env.example`. For this demo purpose you can just rename `.env.example` to `.env`
4. From the root directory run `npm run dev` to start both the front and the backend concurrently.
